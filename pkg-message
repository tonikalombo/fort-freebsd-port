To use FORT, you will need the Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) files.
You can download these by running "fort --init-tals" as follows:

# fort --init-tals --tal "/usr/local/etc/fort/tal

You will also need to adjust at least the "server" section in the
configuration file /usr/local/etc/fort/fort-config.json to suit
your environment.

Consult the FORT manual for more information:
